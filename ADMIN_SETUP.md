# Admin Panel Setup Guide

## Overview
WindMate includes a powerful admin panel for managing user feedback. Access is controlled via URL parameters and environment variables for security.

## Admin Access Methods

### üîß Development Access
```
http://localhost:3002?admin=true
```
- **No security key required** in development mode
- Perfect for testing and development

### üîí Production Access
```
https://yourapp.com?key=your_secret_admin_key
```
- **Requires matching environment variable**
- URL parameter is automatically cleared for security
- Admin key must match `REACT_APP_ADMIN_KEY`

## Environment Variable Setup

### Development (.env)
```bash
# Admin panel access key for development
REACT_APP_ADMIN_KEY=dev_admin_123
```

### Production Environment Variables
Set the following environment variable in your production hosting platform:

#### Vercel
```bash
REACT_APP_ADMIN_KEY=wx2024_admin_$ecure!Key_987
```

#### Netlify
```bash
REACT_APP_ADMIN_KEY=wx2024_admin_$ecure!Key_987
```

#### Heroku
```bash
heroku config:set REACT_APP_ADMIN_KEY=wx2024_admin_$ecure!Key_987
```

#### AWS Amplify
Add to environment variables in the console:
```
REACT_APP_ADMIN_KEY = wx2024_admin_$ecure!Key_987
```

## Security Best Practices

### üîê Admin Key Requirements
- **Minimum 20 characters**
- **Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols**
- **No dictionary words**
- **Unique for each deployment**

### ‚úÖ Good Admin Key Examples
```
wx2024_admin_$ecure!Key_987
WindMate_2024_Admin_9x8z7y
FeedbackAdmin_2024_Secure_Key_789!
```

### ‚ùå Bad Admin Key Examples
```
